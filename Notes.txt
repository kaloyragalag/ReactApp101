1. To run build
	cd ReactApp101

3. Install extension for shortcuts: ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets
	rafce - import one of the default components
	impt - import proptypes
4. useState - need to reference: import { useState } from 'react';

	import {FaTimes} from 'react-icons/fa' --for fontawesome
6. to build prod
	npm run build //create a build folder

	serve -s build -p 8000 //to build in port 8000
7. json server //mock api
	https://github.com/typicode/json-server
	npm i json-server //install locally
	in package.json, add the "server" in scripts parent
		//this will create a db.json file at port 5000
	npm run server
8. import { useEffect } from 'react' //want something to happen when the page loads
	useEffect(() => {}) //function to use
9. npm i react-router-dom //install router
	this will be added in the package.json
		"react-router-dom"
	import {BrowserRouter, Route} from 'react-router-dom'
	to use Route functionality, needs to be wraped in <BrowserRouter/> all the html tags
10. to not load the page, do not use A HREF, but instead:
	import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
	<Link to='/'></Link>
11. import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom'
	//look at the route that are currently on
	const location = useLocation();
	location.pathname //to check the current path
12. to install material ui components --somewhat lik bootstrap
	npm install @mui/material
	https://mui.com/
	https://mui.com/components/material-icons/
13. To run the client and server at the same time, see package.json under scripts
	--but before that, install first concurrently in react project
		npm i -D concurrently
	a. created a script, for this name, set it to dev, this can be any name
	to run the dev script: npm run dev
14. Install react admin
	npm i react-admin ra-data-simple-rest
	https://marmelab.com/react-admin/
15. middleware for reac admin
	since it will need a total count for the api, and we're just using json-server for the API it doesn't have a header
	to implement: add in the script in package.json: --middleware <filename>
